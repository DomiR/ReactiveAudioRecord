A reactive (Rx) implementation of the AudioRecord API for recording raw (pcm) audio-data. Also includes helper methods for the creation of Wave audio files. 

###How to use it?
#####Create an instance of RecorderOnSubscribe giving it the path to the file
```java
final String filePath = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/sample.wav"; //dummy file 
RecorderOnSubscribe recorder = new RecorderOnSubscribe.Builder(filePath)
                                                      .sampleRate(22000)       //by default it's 44100
                                                      .stereo()                //by default it's mono
                                                      .audioSourceCamcorder()  //by default it's MIC
                                                      .createSubscription();
```
#####Use the recorder OnSubscribe to create an observable
```java
Observable.create(recorder)
          .subscribe( shorts -> {
              ...
              recorder.writeShortsToFile(shorts); //a helper method that writes the buffers to (wave) file
          });
```

####After setting up the Observer, manipulate the recording-process by using these methods
```java

recorder.start();

recorder.stop();

recorder.pause();

recorder.resume();

recorder.isRecording(); 

recorder.isRecordingStopped(); //a method to check whether the recorder is in Stopped state

```
####Helper methods for wave file write operations
```java
recorder.writeShortsToFile(shorts); //write the short buffers to a wave file

recorder.completeRecording(); //writes the wave header to file... Call it after the stop() method
```

And that's it! Check out the sample code for a working example!
